## External notifications

The external notification API allows you to send a notification to a certain user. The notification 
will appear under ahead's notifications list in the upper right of the ahead web app, as well as a push notification
should the user have ahead's mobile app installed.

## Fields

The basic payload of a call would looks something like this:

```json {"1. you need to specify one of the two:": 2-4} {"2. You can specify up to 50 messages": 9-10 }
[{

    "userPrincipalName": "joe@company.com",
    "employeeId": "12345"
    "title": "The item(s) you ordered have arrived",
    "body": "Your recent order at our office supplies shop is ready to be picked up",
    "link": "https://internal.officesupplies/orders/1234"
}, 

...
]
```

The payload is an array of objects. The following table describes one of those objects
of which you can send up to 50.

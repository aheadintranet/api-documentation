Provided you use ahead also for files to be shown to users in their personal section,
here you will learn how to do a file upload for a user with postman. This guide assumes that
you already had a look at [how to get an api-key and use postman to upload a profile update](../01-get-apikey-and-use-postman/).

:::caution
When testing, bear in mind that you are testing against the _real API_. We recommend that you perform your
initial tests with a test account created in MS Entra for this purpose, which you can delete after you have verified
that everything works satisfactorily.

## Choose the correct content-type

File uploads need to happen with the `Content-Type` set to `multipart/form-data`.

<Image src={image1} alt="Correct settings in the body" />

This is most easily done by setting up the body tab correctly. This will automatically set the correct
`Content-Type` under the **Headers**-Tab.

## Choose a file

:::caution
Make sure you understand [how the files need to be named](../../reference/06-sending-files/).
:::

Now you can choose a file to upload. 

<Image src={image2} alt="uploading a file" />

You could add additional files to repeating the file selection step in the next row. 

Pressing "Send" starts the request and if all goes well, the response status code should be a merry `200`.

## Verifying the upload

Such a request will also show up in the import logs as a file upload:

```text
2023-11-22T16:20:09 - RequestId: 1bed586b-ed0e-4780-ad06-e9f831ebd3af
Success - FileUploaded - Uploaded file 'November 2023.pdf' for 'joe@company.com'
```

And of course, our test subject joe should now see the new file under their **personal space**.

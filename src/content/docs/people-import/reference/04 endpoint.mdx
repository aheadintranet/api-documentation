:::note
<h4>The ahead profiles API URL is</h4>
<h5>htt<span>ps://connect</span>.aheadintranet.com/api/PeopleImport</h5>
:::

## Request

The API accepts **PUT**s with the following headers.

### x-functions-key

The API-Key necessary to authorize the request

<LinkCard
  title="Authentication & Authorization"
  href="../../../api-keys/"
/>

### Content-Type

Supported content types are

#### multipart/form-data

:::tip
The structure of a multipart/form-data request is formally described at https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2388. It forms the basis of e.g., file uploads from HTML form submissions.
:::

Each part of a multipart request also defines its own content-type. Currently supported are

* application/json - An update of a profile in the form of a **Person update JSON object**.
* application/pdf - A *.pdf document for upload to the personal section of a user

A request may contain up to 50 parts. Each part corresponds to the update of one person or the addition of a file for a person.

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCard
        title="Person update JSON object"
        description="Learn about the specifics of the person update JSON"
        href="../05-person-json-object/"
    />
    <LinkCard
        title="Sending files"
        description="Learn how to transmit files to your user's personal sections"
        href="../06-sending-files/"
    />
</CardGrid>

#### application/json

Send a JSON array of **person update JSON objects**. The array may only contain up to **50 objects**.

:::tip
This kind of API usage only supports the update of fields directly related to profiles. It will **not** allow the upload of files.
In this case, you will need to send `multipart/form-data`-requests
:::

<LinkCard
    title="Person update JSON object"
    description="Learn about the specifics of the person update JSON"
    href="../05-person-json-object/"
/>

## Response

:::caution
Updates will be accepted on a profile-by-profile basis. 
This means that when the API returns the `422` error code, some of the sent profile updates were successful. 
In such cases, you will need to identify the proper logs that are correlated with the GUID provided in the body of the 
response through ahead’s “Integrations” section in the management pages.
:::

### Status Code 200 

The complete request has been processed without issues. The body of the response will contain a GUID with which this particular request
can be identified in the import logs.

### Status Code 400 

If there’s any issue with the request at a basic level (e.g. wrong content type), a status code of `400` (Bad request) will be returned. Another possible reason is when all parts of the request failed to be processed.

### Status Code 403 

A request without API-Key or an unknown API-Key will cause a return of `403`. Such calls will not appear in the protocol.

### Status Code 413

A request contains more than 50 people updates.

### Status Code 422

If there are issues with the data itself, which may only apply to a part of the sent data, a status code of `422` (unprocessable content) will be returned. 
The body of the response will contain a GUID with which this particular request can be identified such that it can be analyzed 
which specific update command went wrong.

Typical conditions that would lead to a 422 response are:
•	A particular JSON object could not be correlated with an existing entry (missing / wrong employeeId field)
•	A JSON object contains fields that are not known as defined in the People Profile Definition
•	A field is known, but contains the wrong kind of data

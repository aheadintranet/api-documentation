Authentication & Authorization is done by generating an **API-Key** through ahead’s administration settings. 
There it is possible to:
* obtain one or several API-Keys and give them a descriptive name to be able to identify import protocols (see chapter on “Responses”)
* delete an API-Key in case that it is not in use anymore or has otherwise leaked into a system with unrestricted visibility.

:::danger
Please take care of your API-Keys. They allow you to import data into the profiles of your users that use ahead. 
If you suspect that the key has been compromised, use the ahead administration interface to revoke the API-Key in question.

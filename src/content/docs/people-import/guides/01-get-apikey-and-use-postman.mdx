:::tip
You should know hot to perform an API request with the [postman tool](https://www.postman.com/) or something similar.
:::

You have been tasked to call the ahead import API to add information to user profiles. Great!
Let us trace the necessary steps that you can successfully call the ahead API with a tool like postman.

## Getting the API-Key

## Doing a profile update in Postman

You will need the correct endpoint URL as well as HTTP Verb, namely PUT. See the following screenshot:

<Image src={image2} alt="The headers tab in postman" />

We will first try an update via a JSON array. You need to add a custom header field named `x-functions-key`.
It's value is the one you copied from the **API-Keys**-section in ahead.
The `Content-Type` header will be set automatically when you go to the **Body**-Tab and set it
to **raw**, choosing **JSON** as the input.

<Image src={image3} alt="The body tab in postman" />

The input should adhere to the structure specified under [The person update JSON object](../../reference/05-person-json-object/).

Now you should be ready to send the request by pressing **Send**!

If all went well, Postman will tell you that the http status code response was `200` and you also got an id
back as the response body.

  href="../03-things-going-wrong/"
/>

## The import log

When you head back to the same page in ahead where you got the API-Keys you should notice that your import
was registered.

Clicking on the details accesses the log file relevant for the import.

Its content would now look like this:

```text
2023-11-22T15:47:38 - RequestId: 98e51b88-932d-4a33-8e13-58fc39d7faf1
Success - PersonUpdated - 'joe@company.com' updated
```

:::tip
When you automate the profile import API calls e.g. in a nightly job, requests done within a short timeframe
will be listed under one entry in the **Import Logs** - hence, one log file may contain several
`request ID`s. That's where the search field comes in handy.

You should now know the basics of how to call the API.

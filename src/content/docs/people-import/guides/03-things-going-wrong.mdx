This guide familiarizes you with how certain errors can look like in ahead's **Import Logs**.
You can also try out such error conditions with Postman, as we will do now.

In this guide we send a JSON-array with profile updates that have some issues and we can compare 
to the output in the import log.

With postman, I send the following data:

```json
[
  {
    "userPrincipalName": "joe@company.com",
    "unknownField": "Hello"
  },
  {
    "userPrincipalName": "unknown@company.com",
    "joinDate": "2023-11-01"
  },
  {
    "name": "Sarah McAllister",
    "joinDate": "2023-11-01"
  }
]
```

In our particular setup, the API returns 400 because all update attempts failed. 
If you have many import log entries, 
you can search with the request ID provided in the body of the response:

<Image src={image1} alt="Searching in the import logs" />

We identified the correct import log and access the details. What you will see is something like this:

```text
2023-11-22T16:32:59 - RequestId: 97aa006e-1fb7-47c6-ad10-1c8331b7d2c7
Error - InvalidPerson - Invalid person in part 0: UnknownFields: 'unknownField'
Error - InvalidPerson - Invalid person in part 2: NoPersonIdentifier: Neither 'userPrincipalName' nor 'employeeId' is provided. | UnknownFields: 'name'
Error - UnknownPerson - Unknown person: 'unknown@company.com'
```

You see that the 1st and 3rd json update object that were sent are listed first. 
This is because they were already rejected based on simple validations.

The 2nd entry provided a correlation property (here the UPN) and a known field, but when attempting
to update, the person was not found.

:::danger
There are two error conditions that will not generate entries in the import log:
* The request was not authorized with an api key or the api key was unknown
* The complete request exceeded the limit of 104 MB

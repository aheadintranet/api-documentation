## Getting the API-Key

First, you will need the API Key. To get it, you need to be an administrator in your ahead intranet 
(or know somebody who is). Under **Company Settings / Integrations** you will find the **API-Keys**.

There it is possible to:
* obtain one or several API-Keys and give them a descriptive name to be able to identify import protocols (see chapter on “Responses”)
* delete an API-Key in case that it is not in use anymore or has otherwise leaked into a system with unrestricted visibility.

When you add one, you need to select for which feature it will be used.

:::danger
Please take care of your API-Keys. They allow you to import data into the profiles of your users that use ahead. 
If you suspect that the key has been compromised, use the ahead administration interface to revoke the API-Key in question.

## Usage

Once created, clicking the _eye_-Symbol will reveal the API-key. Pressing the _copy_-symbol will copy 
the API Key to the clipboard. Now you are equipped to prepare an API-Call to ahead's import API.

:::note
An API-Key will only work for its intended usage. You cannot e.g. use one reated for "Activities" for
the "People Import".
:::

When calling the API, you need to provide the API-Key as copied out from ahead as value to the custom **“x-functions-key”** HTTP-Header.

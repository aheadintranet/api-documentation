## Introduction

This API allows you to publish Events that will become visible on the ahead homepage. Events published in this way support

- Multilinguality (provided your tenant is set up that way)
- Association with one channel
- Targeting to show relevant content to your users

Given the example payload shown below under "Example", the card on the homepage and on the "All events page" would like this:

<Image src={image1} alt="Event Card" />

While the following information would be presented to the user both in English and Spanish:

<Image src={image2} alt="Event Page" />

## Request

The request's **content-type** must be **application/json**.

The JSON must be an object with the following properties:

| Property          | Required | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title             | Yes      | ML-string         | The title of the event.                                                                                     |
| location          | Yes      | ML-string         | The location at which the event takes place.                                     |
| description       | -        | ML-string         | A description that becomes part of the event page information. |
| startDate         | Yes      | ISO-8601 datetime | The start date and time of the event                                                                        |
| endDate           | -        | ISO-8601 datetime | Optional end date and time of the event.                                           |
| author            | Yes      | object            | An object identifying the author that should be used for this particular event.                                                                      |
| channelId         | -        | string            | channel with which this event is associated. You get the id from the copy button in ahead's channel administration.                                  |
| targeting         | -        | object            | Any targeting information to be associated with this document (See further down for the contents of this object).                                    |

### Targeting

The **“targeting”** JSON object is constructed as described on this page:

<LinkCard
  title="Using ahead's targeting via API"
  description="Learn how to provide targeting information to your API payloads"
  href="../../targeting/"
/>

### ML String

The multilanguage string is a json object where the property is a lowercase two-letter ISO language code, and the value is a string.

```json
{ 
  "en": "SAP Upgrade", 
  "de": "SAP Upgrade", 
  "es": "Actualización de SAP" 
}
```
### Author object

The author object must contain one of
* the **“employeeId”** field. This field needs to correlate with a person’s “employeeId” value as stored in MS Entra.
* the **“userPrincipalName”** (UPN). This field needs to correlate with a person’s user principal name in MS Entra.

### Validations

When choosing in which languages to publish the event, please note the following:

* The languages used must be available in the list of **content languages** that your tenant uses in ahead.
* The use of languages must be consistent throughout **title**, **location** and **description**.

For the choice of **author**, it will be checked that

* we can identify a person that can use ahead
* that particular person has **editor permissions**.

For the choice of **targeting**, it will be checked that

* The targeting reaches someone (i.e. somebody is targeted by that particular combination)

### Example

The following would be an example payload:

```json
{
  "title": { "en": "SAP Upgrade", "es": "Actualización de SAP" },
  "location": { "en": "Spain", "es": "España" },
  "description": {
    "en": "SAP systems in Spain will be upgraded. Interruptions will be possible during that time",
    "es": "Se actualizarán los sistemas SAP en España. Interrupciones serán posibles durante ese tiempo"
  },
  "startDate": "2025-01-10T10:00:00.000Z",
  "endDate": "2025-01-10T15:00:00.000Z",
  "author": { "userPrincipalName": "{upn-of-choice}" },
  "channelId": "{your-channel-id}",
  "targeting": {
    "groups": ["{your-group-id}"]
  }
}
```

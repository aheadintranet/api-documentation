## Targeting in ahead

The majority of content on ahead can be targeted to specific users. Targeting is based on defining
a template that can contain
* user groups
* possible property values

<Image src={image1} alt="Targeting concept in ahead" />

A user gets to see ahead content when they have **at least one** match in **all** defined kinds of targeting values.

The properties that can be used are the ones listed in the **"Advanced target audiences"** section in the **"Company settings"**.

:::caution
If your tenant does not have **"Advanced Targeting"** enabled, you can only used targeting based on the groups property.

## API

When an API supports targeting, the sent JSON should define a **targeting** property that follows the following structure:

| Property     | Type      | Description                                                                                       |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \{property\} | string[]  | Any user property that is being targeted. If the user has any of the values listed here, the document will be used as a source to create an answer |
| groups       | string[]  | Known as predefined groups in ahead, if the asking user is a member of the group, the document will be used as a source to create an answer. |


Usually the **targeting**-property is optional. If it is missing, we assume that the content is meant to be seen by all of the company.

### Example

When an API supports targeting, this would be a valid example of targeting:

```json
{
  ...
  "targeting": {
    "city": ["Atlanta", "Miami"],
    "groups": ["476c46e5-0165-4afb-b0c7-563b56db93d5"]
  }
}
```

Content associated with this target will be visible to users, who
* belong to the group identified by the provided id **AND**
* whose "city" property is either _"Atlanta"_ **OR** _"Miami"_

:::note
**Targeting != Privateness**. Generally, targeting is used to provide users with relevant content.
Users can still see all content if they wish to do so.

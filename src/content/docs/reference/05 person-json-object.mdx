title: The person update JSON object
description: Learn about the JSON object that updates a single person in the ahead people store
---

A person update JSON object may appear as

* part with content-type: application/json in a multipart 
* as element of a JSON array within the body of a request whose content-type is application/json.

Each JSON object must contain one of 
* the **“employeeId”** field. This field needs to correlate with a person’s “employeeId” value as stored in MS Entra.
* the **“userPrincipalName”** (UPN). This field needs to correlate with a person’s user principal name in MS Entra.

Given that the following field has been defined in the people profile definition:

```json
{
    "name": "birthDate",
    "fieldType": "Date",
    "source": "Api"
}
```

Then the following update JSON would update the user with the UPN `joe@company.com` and add (_or update_) its birthday field.

```json
{
    "userPrincipalName": "joe@company.com",
    "birthDate": "1985-10-03",
}
```

Sending a null for a supported field effectively deletes the value

```json
{
    "userPrincipalName": "joe@company.com",
    "birthDate": null,
}
```

In other words, the update object may contain values for all or a subset of the fields that are marked with source = API 
in the people profile definition.

Provided that ahead is successful in correlating the person via one of the correlation fields, the provided values will be 
merged with the existing values. In short, the following rules apply:

*	Any fields not referenced will be left untouched.
*	Provided fields will overwrite any previously existing values.
*	If the API call sends “null” for a field, ahead will take this value and use it to overwrite / reset that specific value.

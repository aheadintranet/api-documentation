In order to send a file to ahead, a field needs to be specified in the people profile definition to accept a certain kind of file.

```json
{
    "name": "salary",
    "fieldType": "File",
    "source": "Api",
    "isList": true
}
```

In this example, files of type **salary** can be sent to ahead. The filename of the file(s) being sent via a 
`multipart/form-data` request needs to follow a certain structure:

```text
{userIdentifier}__{fieldName}__{fileName}.pdf
```

Note the **<u>2</u>** underscores between the pieces of information. Following the example, 
the following would be a valid file name:

```text
joe@company.com__salary__March 2023.pdf
```

It would upload a new file named **March 2023.pdf** under the **salary** category for the user with the UPN joe@company.com

:::tip
When you upload the **same** file again (i,e, with the same combination of **field name** and **file name**), the current file will be replaced
much like on a file system with automatic overwrite. In the import logs you will see the difference by finding any of such entries:

```text
Success - FileUploaded - Uploaded file 'salary/March 2023.pdf' for 'joe@company.com'
...
Success - FileUploaded - Replaced file 'salary/March 2023.pdf' for 'joe@company.com'
```
:::

You can send up to **50 files** per multipart request.

:::danger
Regardless of whether you send 50 files on a request, please note that the 
total size of the request should **not** exceed **104 Megabytes**. 
The request will not be processed if it exceeds that size.

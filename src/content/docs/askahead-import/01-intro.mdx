This page provides the detailed specification for the Document Import API, 
which allows to import documents to be used as sources for the ask ahead feature of ahead, 
in which a user can ask questions and the system will generate responses based on the provided sources. 
The Document Import API is designed to handle bulk document uploads with metadata options, 
ensuring that content can be targeted to specific user groups or languages within your organization. 

:::note
**The ask ahead document import API URL is**
```text
https://connect.aheadintranet.com/api/AskAheadImport
```

## Document metadata

Metadata relevant to a document is

* **Targeting**<br/>
  Much like targeted content in ahead, documents associated with targeting will not be considered 
  if the user asking the question does not match the targeting properties.
* **Document Language**<br/>
  If a document gets associated with a specific language, then the content language of the asking user 
  must match the language associated with a document.
  The way information is stored in a Vector database means that the extracted content is generally language independent. As an example, ask ahead also allows answering questions in English even though the query’s source was provided in German.
* **Tags**<br/>
  A list of terms may be associated with a document which can aid the ranking of results based on a 
  user’s question.
* **Source url**<br/>
  In ask ahead, an answer lists the sources it derives the answer from. The default behavior is that the underlying file is opened. If a source link is provided, ahead will use that URL to open when listing the source.

The metadata can be provided in the following ways:

1.	As HTTP headers in the request – this has certain implications:
    1.	The metadata applies to all documents sent in that request
    1.	In the case of the source URL, this forces the request to only contain a single document
2.	As final part of content-type application/json in a multipart request. <br/>
    Note that only metadata for files that are being uploaded in the same request will be used, 
    other metadata items will be ignored.
3.	As only payload in a request with content-type application/json



## Request

The following content-types are understood by the endpoint, **multipart/form-data** to transmit files and metadata
as well as **application/json** to receive metadata updates.

In any case, the following HTTP headers are supported and evaluated:

| Header   | Required | Description  |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| x-targeting-groups     | N      | A comma separated list of GUIDs pointing to ahead's predefined group. |
| x-targeting-\{name\}   | N      | `name` may be any of the properties in use for targeting. If multiple values are given, they need to be separated by commas. |
| x-document-languages   | N      | Comma-separated ISO-2 language codes that associate the document(s) with the language - they will only be queried for ahead users whose content language corresponds to one of the provided languages. The language(s) must be a subset of the tenant languages. |
| x-source-url           | N      | When the document is listed as source, this URL will be used as the target of the source link.

:::caution
The metadata provided through these headers apply to all documents sent in that request. 
The header **x-source-url** forces the request to only contain a single document, 
otherwise the request will be considered wrong (400 bad request).

### multipart/form-data

The following content types are supported for each part of a multipart request:

| Content type                                                                 | Description                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| application/json                                                             | A JSON file that follows the specification in “application/json” |
| application/text                                                             | A text document                                 |
| application/pdf                                                              | A pdf document                                  |
| text/html                                                                    | An html document                                |
| application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document      | A docx document                                 |
| application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet            | A xslx document                                 |

A request may contain up to **50 documents**. The full size of the request may not exceed **104 MB**.

The **filename** of each part can be freely chosen. ahead will use the content type to determine the content of the file.
Note that the file name will be shown when the underlying sources are listed to a user asking a question.  

If later requests use the same file name (i.e. a document known by ahead), it triggers an update of that document.


### application/json

The JSON must be an array where each item is a JSON object. It supports the following properties:

| Property          | Mandatory | Type      | Description                                                                                                              |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fileName          | Y         | string    | Defines on which document the following metadata will be applied                                                         |
| targeting         | N         | object    | Any targeting information to be associated with this document (See further down for the contents of this object)         |
| documentLanguage  | N         | string[]  | An array of ISO-2 language codes which will mean that the content language of the asking user must match the language(s) specified for this document |
| sourceURL         | N         | string    | This URL will be used when the source is being cited in an “ask ahead” answer                                             |
| tags              | N         | string[]  | Any terms that you want associated with that document and aid in ranking sources for answering a question.                |

The “targeting” JSON object is constructed as follows:

| Property     | Type      | Description                                                                                       |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \{property\} | string[]  | Any user property that is being targeted. If the user has any of the values listed here, the document will be used as a source to create an answer |
| groups       | string[]  | Known as predefined groups in ahead, if the asking user is a member of the group, the document will be used as a source to create an answer. |

Here is an example JSON for a metadata update of documents **"process-1.txt"** and **"process-2.txt"**.

```json
[
  {
    "fileName": "process-1.txt",
    "targeting": {
      "city": ["Atlanta", "Miami"],
    },
    "documentLanguage": ["en"],
    "sourceURL": "https://processes.company.com/1/en",
    "tags": ["HR", "Travel"]
  },
  {
    "fileName": "process-2.txt",
    "targeting": {
      "groups": ["476c46e5-0165-4afb-b0c7-563b56db93d5"]
    },
    "sourceURL": "https://legacy.com/expenses",
    "tags": ["HR"]
  }
]

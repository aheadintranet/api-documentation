## External activities

External activities (or simply activities) are basic snippets of information that are sent 
to a ahead via a POST request.

:::note
In most cases, you can interact with the functionality via Zapier. How to do this is well-documented 
on [ahead's help site][help]. Read on if you want to integrate with the API yourself.

## Fields

The basic payload of an activity would look something like this:

```json

    "title": "Weather in BCN",
    "text": "Sunny with 23 degrees.",
    "origin": "weather.com"
    "mediaurl": "http://cdn.io/bcn.jpg",
    "url": "http://weather.com/locations/bcn",
    "targetAudience": "All",
    "identifier": "weather-bcn"
}
```
